            <p>Introducing the Ruby Keyboard, a custom-made keyboard designed with ergonomics and efficiency in mind.
                The Ruby Keyboard boasts a unique layout based on the popular Colemak design, which has been shown to
                improve typing speed and reduce strain on the fingers and wrists. With a split configuration, the Ruby
                Keyboard allows for a comfortable, natural typing position that reduces the risk of repetitive strain
                injuries.</p>
            <p>One of the standout features of the Ruby Keyboard is its modular design. The keyboard is designed with a
                master-slave configuration, which means that it can be easily expanded with additional modules like a
                numpad or media pad. This allows you to customize your workspace to suit your specific needs and
                preferences, without sacrificing comfort or functionality.</p>
            <p>At Team Ruby, we understand that a keyboard is more than just a tool for typing. It’s an extension of
                your personality and an essential component of your work environment. That’s why we’ve designed the Ruby
                Keyboard with aesthetics in mind, combining sleek, modern design with high-quality materials and
                craftsmanship. Whether you’re a gamer, a programmer, or just someone who spends a lot of time typing,
                the Ruby Keyboard is the perfect blend of form and function.</p>

            <h1 id="extra-project-info">Extra project info</h1>
            <p>In our quest to challenge the long-standing restrictions imposed by traditional typewriters, we embarked
                on the creation of a custom keyboard that breaks free from conventional design norms. Our vision
                materialized into a split ortholinear column-staggered ergonomic keyboard, equipped with a thumb cluster
                and shortcut keys. Using primarily from the Colemak layout, we developed a modified 69% layout that
                optimizes key placement for enhanced typing efficiency.</p>
            <p>Our shared passion for computers and coding fueled our motivation to embark on this project. Recognizing
                the significant amount of time we spend on our computers and the importance of comfortable typing
                experiences, we set out to create a keyboard tailored to our specific needs. Moreover, the inherent
                intrigue and challenge of the project enticed us to dive into the realm of keyboard design and
                customization.</p>
            <p>Early on, we established the layout for our keyboard, setting the foundation for subsequent development.
                We began creating a website to document our progress, continuously iterating and refining it along the
                way. Extensive research on both software and hardware components followed, guiding our decision-making
                process. With our knowledge and plans in place, we proceeded to order the necessary components and
                designed the PCB.</p>
            <p>The testing phase proved to be pivotal, as it allowed us to uncover various challenges and issues. We
                encountered delays in shipping, encountered a scented candle incident during the testing of the rotary
                encoder, and faced complications related to MOSFET selection. The Ergobleds presented unexpected voltage
                issues, and we discovered the need to address the I2C pins and IO expanders. Furthermore, a reversed pot
                LED and a poor 3V3 connection to the PCB demanded our attention. Additionally, we confronted the
                perplexing assignment of Wire1 and Wire0, a perplexing quirk of the Xiao RP2040.</p>
            <p>Throughout this journey, we found inspiration in Zack Friedman’s Mirage keyboard, drawing valuable
                insights from his informative videos. Furthermore, our decision to delve into learning the Colemak
                keyboard layout added a layer of enjoyment and personal growth to the project. With its hackable nature,
                our keyboard is designed to cater to the needs of those who appreciate tinkering and customization,
                offering limitless possibilities for adaptation and personalization.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, we envision refining our software, introducing an array of features, and developing a
                user-friendly GUI to streamline the customization process. We are committed to providing a comprehensive
                software experience, complementing the hardware’s capabilities. Our ultimate aim is to create a
                versatile keyboard that caters to diverse user preferences while fostering a seamless and enjoyable
                typing experience.</p>
            <p>Through this project, we strive to challenge the status quo, infusing innovation and personalization into
                the realm of keyboard design. By pushing the boundaries and embracing the spirit of exploration, we aim
                to empower individuals to tailor their typing experience to their unique needs and preferences.</p>

            <p>Naturally, we didn’t just pull this layout out of our asses, we spent a considerable amount of time on
                designing this layout</p>

            <h2 id="why-colemak">Why colemak</h2>
            <p>I’ve always found the AZERTY layout (which is the default layout in Belgium) accessibly hideous. The
                symbol layer is just absolute garbage. And who in their right mind would like to type symbols over
                numbers. It’s called a number row for a reason… My frustrations with this layout went to the extent I
                learned qwerty a couple years ago. I have been using that as my daily driver till a little more than a
                year ago when I searched for something even better. This is also when I stumbled onto colemak. This
                powerhouse of a layout makes typing very fast and efficient because it puts the most used keys in easy
                accessible spots like the home row. While keeping the most common shortcut keys in the same place (CTRL
                A, Z, X, C, V). It also only moves 2 keys between hands (p and e) and it puts the most typed keys on the
                strongest fingers. All of this goodness makes it so that your fingers move 2.2 times less than on
                qwerty, have 16 times less row jumping and there are 35 times more words you can type only using the
                home row. It’s also the 3rd most common layout in the world and has a thriving community of people that
                make “tweaks” of the layout to suit any of your special needs.</p>

            <h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>
            <p>Our year project involves building a custom keyboard from the ground up, starting with the hardware. The
                first step was selecting the various components we needed to create a functional keyboard. We began by
                choosing a microcontroller, settling on the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040. This microcontroller was selected
                for its low cost and compatibility with a wide range of programming languages. We acquired it from
                SeeedStudio for €5.43.</p>
            <p>To expand the I/O capabilities of the microcontroller, we also added an I/O expander - the NXP Semicon
                PCA9555PW,118 - which we acquired from lcsc for €0.74. We also added reverse mount LED lights (SK6812
                MINI-E) from AliExpress, costing €5.85 for 100 pieces, as well as Gateron yellow Pro switches (220
                pieces) for €49.74 from AliExpress.</p>
            <p>Other components we included in the hardware were rotary encoders (EC12SXB2) from AliExpress, hot-swap
                sockets (CPG151101S11) from AliExpress, a headphone jack (PJ-313B6-B) from lcsc, capacitors
                (CL05B104KO5NNNC) from lcsc, and resistors (RC0402FR-0710KL) from lcsc. We acquired 5 PCBs from jlcpcb
                for €15.00. To complete the hardware, we designed and 3D printed the case and key caps, which cost
                €10.00 each.</p>
            <p>With shipping costs, the total cost of the board was approximately €80. Our objective was to create a
                keyboard that was both affordable and functional, and we believe we have achieved this goal by carefully
                selecting the components and ensuring compatibility between them. You can check all the components in
                the table below.</p>

            <h1 id="firmware">Firmware</h1>
            <p>For our custom keyboard project, we are currently using Arduino as our development platform for the
                firmware. We chose Arduino because of its simplicity and ease of use, as well as the availability of
                libraries specifically designed for the Seeed Studio XIAO microcontroller. Additionally, the Arduino
                code we’re using compiles to UF2, which makes it easy to flash onto the microcontroller.</p>
            <p>However, we are also considering alternative firmware options for future iterations of our project. One
                promising candidate is the ZMK (Zephyr for Mechanical Keyboards) firmware. ZMK offers a comprehensive
                set of pre-existing functions and features, potentially eliminating the need to develop certain
                functionalities from scratch. Additionally, ZMK has good compatibility with many different types of
                keyboards and operating systems, which would be beneficial if we wanted to make the keyboard more
                accessible to a wider range of users.</p>
            <p>Another possibility we are exploring is transitioning to a different programming language such as C++ or
                Rust for firmware development. Switching to these languages could offer benefits such as cleaner code
                structure and improved performance, making the firmware more efficient and responsive.</p>
            <p>At this moment, while we continue to use Arduino, we are actively evaluating the advantages and
                trade-offs of ZMK and different programming languages. We aim to select the best-fit solution for our
                project based on factors such as functionality, ease of development, compatibility with various
                operating systems, and overall code quality.</p>
            <p>Regardless of which development platform we ultimately choose, our objective is to create a firmware that
                is programmable, customizable, and compatible with a variety of different operating systems. We want to
                ensure that our custom keyboard is easy to use and can be tailored to the specific needs of each user

            <h1 id="software">Software</h1>
            <p>For code development, we primarily use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) due to its open-source nature and the
                availability of numerous high-quality extensions. However, we occasionally resort to the Arduino editor
                when encountering issues with compiling our Arduino code.</p>
            <p>We also wish to make a software component for our custom keyboard project. It involves developing an
                application that runs on a PC and interacts with the firmware on the microcontroller. Our aim is to
                create a user-friendly software interface that allows users to customize key mappings, lighting effects,
                macros, and even configure the behavior of the extra shortcut/macro buttons on the keyboard based on the
                currently active application on the PC.</p>
            <p>To achieve this, we are considering developing the software application using the Rust programming
                language. While we acknowledge that our proficiency in Rust is still developing, this project presents
                an excellent opportunity for us to deepen our understanding and expertise in this language. Rust’s
                performance, memory safety, and clean code structure align well with our objectives for the software.
            </p>
            <p>One of the main functionalities of the software application will be to provide a graphical user interface
                (GUI) through which users can intuitively customize their keyboard settings. This includes a detailed
                setup wizard, installation guide and a build guide for new users</p>

            <h1 id="testing-phase">Testing phase</h1>
            <p>During the testing phase of our project, our primary objective was to thoroughly evaluate and validate
                the functionality of all components involved in the creation of our custom keyboard. The aim was to
                identify and address any issues or challenges before ordering the official version of the PCB, ensuring
                a smooth and successful implementation.</p>
            <p>We conducted comprehensive testing for all the components required for the full keyboard, covering both
                their standalone functionality and their integration within the PCB. To facilitate testing, we utilized
                various tools and equipment, including a multimeter, an oscilloscope, extra components, breadboards, and
                a soldering iron.</p>
            <p>Throughout this critical phase, we encountered several challenges that required our attention and
                problem-solving skills. These challenges included shipping delays, the unexpected scented candle
                incident, MOSFET related issues, problems with the Ergobleds, issues with the I2C pins and IO expanders,
                a reversed encoder LED, a poor 3V3 connection to the PCB, and the confusing wire assignments of Wire1
                and Wire0. You will read about our issues in detail in the next section of our documentation.</p>
            <p>Despite these challenges, the testing phase proved to be one of the most significant and time-consuming
                aspects of our project. It allowed us to thoroughly assess the performance and compatibility of our
                components, identify potential areas for improvement, and refine the PCB design to address the
                discovered problems. By investing considerable time and effort in testing, we aimed to minimize any
                unforeseen surprises and ensure that our final version of the keyboard would meet our desired
                specifications and functionality.</p>
            <p>Overall, the testing phase played a crucial role in the development and refinement of our project. It
                provided us with valuable insights, troubleshooting opportunities, and the opportunity to make informed
                decisions to enhance the overall quality and performance of our custom keyboard.</p>

            <h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>
            <h3 id="shipping-problems">1. Shipping problems:</h3>
            <p>The initial shipping delay of the PCBs caused a significant setback in our project timeline, resulting in
                the inability to test various components and overall project delays.</p>
            <h3 id="scented-candle">2. Scented candle:</h3>
            <p>During the initial testing of the rotary encoder, due to the default program loaded on the Seeed Studio
                XIAO RP2040, the pins connected to the encoder outputs started emitting a burning smell. This led to a
                humorous reference to it as our “scented candle.” Surprisingly, the rotary encoder still functioned
                correctly once we uploaded the appropriate program.</p>
            <h3 id="mosfet">3. MOSFET:</h3>
            <p>Accidentally forgetting to order the MOSFET initially required improvisation. We utilized a MOSFET we had
                on hand and adjusted the resistor values to ensure proper functionality. The MOSFET was necessary to
                convert the 3.3V data signal to 5V.</p>
            <h3 id="ergobleds">4. Ergobleds:</h3>
            <p>Apart from the MOSFET issue, we encountered a steady 5V on the data line of the Ergobleds, which was
                unexpected. After extensive troubleshooting, we discovered that a LED was inserted into its socket
                rotated by 180 degrees. This discrepancy was missed during the PCB design phase. We rectified the issue
                in the subsequent PCB revision by ensuring the correct orientation of the LED used for the encoder.</p>
            <h3 id="bad-3v3-connection-to-pcb">5. Bad 3V3 connection to PCB:</h3>
            <p>The pads on which the XIAO was soldered turned out to be slightly smaller than ideal, resulting in a poor
                3.3V connection. This issue also impacted the proper functioning of the LEDs. In the subsequent PCB
                revision, we addressed this problem by adjusting the pad size.</p>
            <h3 id="wire1--wire0--wire1">6. Wire1 = Wire0 =! Wire1:</h3>
            <p>A frustrating challenge we encountered was the ambiguity surrounding the I2C interfaces of the XIAO
                RP2040. While the default I2C interface is located on pins D4 and D5, corresponding to processor pins 6
                and 7 (I2C1), it is unexpectedly referred to as “Wire0.” This discrepancy can cause confusion since the
                RP2040 offers two I2C interfaces, accessible from multiple pins. To utilize I2C on specific pins (D2-3
                or P28-29 connected to I2C1 and D8-10 or P2-3 connected to I2C0), we had to use “Wire0” and “Wire1,”
                respectively. Unfortunately, this information was not clearly documented on the official website</p>
